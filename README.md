# Cogs-108-Data-analysis

Background Introduction
We all know that a movie's success is an end-product of multiple factors. Then what are they and how they influence the success of a movie? Before answering this question, we define success as both financially and evaluatively. That is, a high box office as well as a high public review are the two indicators of a film's success.

We have heard a few guesses about what determines a movie's success. Traditionally, people believe that budget is an important one, that movies with bigger productions will have greater financial success, as well as the success among critics. But in the recent years, many exceptions of that belief are recorded. Some movies with low production turn out to have qualities. Are our old believes not working anymore? What are the ture determinants of a successful film?

This is the questioin we are going to answer in our project. We predict that some obvious factors may not be the only factors in determining a movie's revenue. Moreover, there should be other unnoticeable factors that are only derivable by analyzing big data. We predict that the interactions of these factors will allow us to determine if a movie will be successful or not.

Project Outline
This notebook is divided into several parts. Each part focuses on one specific aspect of a film and its influence on the fillm's profit. We want to deeply explore each factor. These factors include not only explicit ones like budgets, actors, genres, and public reviews; but also implicit ones like years released, production company, the combinations of different genres, and the keywords most related to the movie. At the end of our project, we hope to find a strong factor or a combination of many factors that affects a movieâ€™s revenue so that we can understand how the movie industry should improve by spending resources on more important aspects of a film.
